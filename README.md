# fullthrottle task

I have built this app entirely in Reactjs
The libraries that I used are :
**_react-calendar_**
**_moment_**
**_json-server_**

## steps to run the app

first run the fake api server using command:

```
 npm run server
```

then run the app using the command:

```
npm start
```

## The working explanation

When we run the fake api server, it makes the data available for the app.
then app fetches the data that is available and interprets the data in the expected manner.
